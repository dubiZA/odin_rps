        The Problem:
        Write a program that pits human against machine in a match of rock, paper, scissors. Provide a way
        for the computer to make a selection of either rock, paper or scissors. Provide a way for a human to
        make a selection. Compare the human and computer selections to determine the round winner. The game should
        have five rounds, afterwhich a game winner is determined based on the number of rounds won.

        In this iteration of the project, there will only be a command-line/console interface. The only user input
        will be allowing users to provide their selection of rock, paper or scissors. The output will be the winning
        selection and if it was computer or player who won.

        Pseudocode
        Prompt user for their selection of rock, paper or scissors
        Store user input in a variable
        Have computer make a selection
        Compare user and computer selections and return the winner
        Repeat the game 5 times
        */
        const playerSelection = window.prompt("Enter your selection (rock, paper or scissors):");
        const computerSelection = "";

        function computerPlay() {
            return computerSelection
        }

        function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
            return winner
        }
